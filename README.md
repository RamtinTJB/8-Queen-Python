# 8-Queen-Python
The eight queen puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chess board so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This is a basic implementation for solving the puzzle by using backtracking algorithm.

How to run the program:
* You need to install pygame and python 3.6 (pygame somehow doesnt work properly with newer versions of python on macos)
* python main.py
* Select the squares on which you want to put a queen
* Press space to see the solution
