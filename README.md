# 8-Queen-Python
The eight queen puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chess board so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This is a basic implementation for solving the puzzle by using backtracking algorithm.
